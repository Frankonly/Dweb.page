        <h2>About Pact</h2>
        <p>Pact is a new generation of simple and highly secure file transfer. It’s one of the first distributed
          websites running in your browser, meaning you are in complete control of your own data. We
          neither have access to your encrypted data nor can we prevent you from sharing and receiving this data. By
          design, it’s impossible to alter your data during the transfer process. Additionally, the
          integrated transfer history allows you to claim the ownership of your data and provides a transparent
          logging system. </p>
        <p>Currently, the service allows for the transfer of files up to 1GB. The recipient can download the
          file for 3 days. </p>
        <p>If you choose password protection, we recommend using two separate channels: <br>
          1) for sharing the file link and <br>
          2) for the password link. <br>
          To maximize security, consider using a channel you are confident only the intended receiver has access to.
          Usually, using email for the file link and WhatsApp for the password link works fine. </p>
        <h2>The Technology</h2>
        <p>We are using the latest advantages in the field of the distributed ledger technology for our file transfer
          service. The files
          are uploaded on a distributed file system named <a href="https://ipfs.io/" target="_blank">IPFS</a> and
          uploads, as well as downloads, are logged on an immutable distributed ledger named <a href="https://www.iota.org/"
            target="_blank">IOTA</a>. This way files are transfered
          immutable
          and distributed on IPFS. IOTA makes sure that nobody can delete or alter the logs. Furthermore, we
          implemented the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/" target="_blank">Web Crypto API</a>
          (AES256-GCM) to fully encrypt the files inside your browser before they get even uploaded. The same
          encryption
          algorithm is, for example, recommended by the German Medical Association. </p>
        <p>The website itself is hosted on different servers, which you can also access directly in case
          someone starts to blog our service. If you open Pact you will see a random select version of the
          website. Uploaded files can be download from any <a href="https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/"
            target="_blank">IPFS gateway</a> or simply under the generated link. </p>
        <p>You can find the complete source code as well as our security whitepaper on <a href="https://github.com/PACTCare/Pact"
            target="_blank">Github</a>. </p>
        <h2>Participate</h2>
        <p>If you wish to participate you can simply set up your own IPFS node with a writeable gateway. You need
          to
          allow a maximum upload size on your server of 1GB. Lastly, reach out to us at info[at]pact[dot]care so
          we then can integrate your side on our main page. Currently, we share the IOTA donations equally among
          all participants at the end of every month. For transparency, you can track all donations under the
          current <a href="https://thetangle.org/address/SSFQNEKDAMMAJSTMLRPIHSKZMHQTMYITPPLUWLOPYKS9K9YDGJZKTNQHJVD9YGZFOVZKAZHDIDMFWJGUY"
            target="_blank"> IOTA donation address</a>. In the future, we might set up an advertising model
          to make it more attractive for IPFS nodes to participate.
        </p>
        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>Pact was developed by <a href="https://pact.care/" target="_blank">Pact Care BV</a>, a young startup based
          in Amsterdam. We would love you supporting
          us in our efforts, for example, by reaching out or simply reading more about our initiatives on our <a href="https://blog.florence.chat/"
            target="_blank">official medium blog</a>.</p>

      </div>
      <div id="Terms" class="tabcontent">
        <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
        <p><strong>1) Introduction</strong><br> a) Pact provides a simple way to transfer confidential and
          end-to-end
          encrypted digital files up to a maximum total size of 1 GB (“Service”)<br> b) Pact is free from
          registration
          and charge.<br> c) In this policy, “We”, “Us” and “Our” refer to PACT Care BV. For more information
          about
          us, see Section 11.
          <br> d) By using our Service, you accept these terms and conditions in full; accordingly, if you
          disagree
          with these terms and conditions or any part of these terms and conditions, you must not use our
          Service.
          <br> e) Your file will be automatically encrypted in your browser (AES256-GCM) before the upload. After
          that,
          you receive a unique file id (hash) as well as a password. The file is available for at least 3 days.
          <br>f)
          It’s recommended to use two different channels to send the file id and password. At least to one
          channel
          only the intended receiver should have access. In most cases, email for the file id and WhatsApp for
          the
          password should be fine.
          <br> g) Pact will permanently delete the uploaded files after the expiry
          period
          mentioned in Section 1e. However, since the file transfer is based on a distributed storage network
          named
          IPFS, in rare cases other servers could copy the end-to-end files and thus provide the files even after
          the
          expiry period.
          <br>h) Please keep that in mind that this Service is still in beta phase.
        </p>
        <p><strong>2) License</strong>
          <br>You can find the full license of Pact on our <a href="https://github.com/PACTCare/Pact/blob/master/LICENSE">GitHub
            page</a>.
        </p>
        <p><strong>3) Confidentiality</strong>
          <br>a) You acknowledge that download links and passwords can be forwarded and whoever is passed on or
          has
          access to a download link can download the files contained in that transfer. It's the responsibility of
          the
          uploader to share and take the right precautions to keep password safe.
          <br>b) Pact provides a public log of transactions that is stored on a distributed ledger
          named
          IOTA. This log includes the file id, gateway, encryption status, signature as well as the date and time of
          uploading and downloading of the file transmitted.
        </p>
        <p><strong>4) File ownership, permissions, and responsibility</strong><br>a) You are fully and solely
          responsible
          and accountable for all materials and information that you upload, post or otherwise transmit via the
