      <h2>About Pact</h2>
      <p>Pact.online is a new generation of simple and highly secure file transfer. It’s one of the first decentralized
        websites running in your browser, meaning you are in complete control of your own data. We
        neither have access to your encrypted data nor can we prevent you from sharing and receiving this data. By
        design, it’s impossible to alter your data during the transfer process. Additionally, the
        integrated transfer history allows you to claim the ownership of your data and provides a transparent
        logging system. </p>
      <p>Currently, the service allows for the transfer of files up to 1GB. The recipient can download the
        file for 3 days. </p>
      <p>If you choose password protection, we recommend using two separate channels: <br>
        1) for sharing the file link and <br>
        2) for the password link. <br>
        To maximize security, consider using a channel you are confident only the intended receiver has access to.
        Usually, using email for the file link and WhatsApp for the password link works fine. </p>
      <h2>The Technology</h2>
      <p>We are using the latest advantages in the field of the distributed ledger technology for our file transfer
        service. The files
        are uploaded on a distributed file system named <a href="https://ipfs.io/" target="_blank">IPFS</a> and
        uploads, as well as downloads, are logged on an immutable distributed ledger named <a href="https://www.iota.org/"
          target="_blank">IOTA</a>. This way files are transfered
        immutable
        and decentralized on IPFS. IOTA makes sure that nobody can delete or alter the logs. Furthermore, we
        implemented the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/" target="_blank">Web Crypto API</a>
        (AES256-GCM) to fully encrypt the files inside your browser before they get even uploaded. The same encryption
        algorithm is, for example, recommended by the German Medical Association. </p>
      <p>The website itself is hosted on different servers, which you can also access directly in case
        someone starts to blog our service. If you open pact.online you will see a random select version of the
        website. Uploaded files can be download from any <a href="https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/"
          target="_blank">IPFS gateway</a> or simply under the generated link. </p>
      <p>You can find the complete source code as well as our security whitepaper on <a href="https://github.com/PACTCare/Pact.online"
          target="_blank">Github</a>. </p>
      <h2>Participate</h2>
      <p>If you wish to participate you can simply set up your own IPFS node with a writeable gateway. You need
        to
        allow a maximum upload size on your server of 1GB. Lastly, reach out to us at info[at]pact[dot]care so
        we then can integrate your side on our main page. Currently, we share the IOTA donations equally among
        all participants at the end of every month. For transparency, you can track all donations under the
        current <a href="https://thetangle.org/address/SSFQNEKDAMMAJSTMLRPIHSKZMHQTMYITPPLUWLOPYKS9K9YDGJZKTNQHJVD9YGZFOVZKAZHDIDMFWJGUY"
          target="_blank"> IOTA donation address</a>. In the future, we might set up an advertising model
        to make it more attractive for IPFS nodes to participate.

      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>Pact.online was developed by <a href="https://pact.care/" target="_blank">Pact Care</a>, a young startup based
        in Amsterdam. We would love you supporting
        us in our efforts, for example, by reaching out or simply reading more about our initiatives on our <a href="https://blog.florence.chat/"
          target="_blank">official medium blog</a>.</p>

    <div id="Terms" class="tabcontent">
      <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
      <p><strong>1) Introduction</strong><br> a) PACT provides a simple way to transfer confidential and
        end-to-end
        encrypted digital files up to a maximum total size of 1 GB (“Service”)<br> b) PACT is free from
        registration
        and charge.<br> c) In this policy, “We”, “Us” and “Our” refer to PACT Care BV. For more information
        about
        us, see Section 11.
        <br> d) By using our Service, you accept these terms and conditions in full; accordingly, if you
        disagree
        with these terms and conditions or any part of these terms and conditions, you must not use our
        Service.
        <br> e) Your file will be automatically encrypted in your browser (AES256-GCM) before the upload. After
        that,
        you receive a unique file id (hash) as well as a password. The file is available for at least 3 days.
        f)
        It’s recommended to use two different channels to send the file id and password. At least to one
        channel
        only the intended receiver should have access. In most cases, email for the file id and WhatsApp for
        the
        password should be fine. <br> g) PACT will permanently delete the uploaded files after the expiry
        period
        mentioned in Section 1e. However, since the file transfer is based on a decentralized storage network
        named
        IPFS, in rare cases other servers could copy the end-to-end files and thus provide the files even after
        the
        expiry period. h) Please keep that in mind that this Service is still in beta phase.

        <br>e) In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your personal data without undue
        delay.
        Those circumstances include: the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for
        which
        they were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based processing; you
        object
        to the processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law and the personal data have been
        unlawfully
        processed. However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure. The general exclusions include where
        processing
        is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a
        legal
        obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
        <br>f) In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. Those
        circumstances
        are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure; we
        no
        longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal data for the
        establishment,
        exercise or defense of legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the verification of
        that
        objection. Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal
        data.
        However, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or
        defense
        of legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of
        important
        public interest.
        <br>g) You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your
        particular
        situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is
        necessary
        for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any official
        authority
        vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you
        make
        such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate
        compelling
        legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the
        processing
        is for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
        <br>h) You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for scientific or
        historical
        research purposes or statistical purposes on grounds relating to your particular situation, unless the
        processing
        is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest. To the extent
        that
        the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is:
        <br>i) consent; or
        <br>ii) that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in
        order
        to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, and such processing is carried out by
        automated
        means, you have the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and
        machine-readable
        format. However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of
        others.
        <br>i) If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws,
        you
        have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection.
        You
        may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the
        alleged
        infringement.
        <br>j) To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent,
        you
        have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of
        processing
        before the withdrawal.
        <br>k) You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by written notice to us.
