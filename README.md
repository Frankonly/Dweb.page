# Pact.online

Pact.online is a new generation of simple and highly secure file transfer. It’s one of the first decentralized websites running in your browser, meaning you are in complete control of your own data. We neither have access to your encrypted data nor can we prevent you from sharing and receiving this data. By design, it’s impossible to alter your data during the transfer process. Additionally, the integrated transfer history allows you to claim the ownership of your data and provides a transparent logging system.
